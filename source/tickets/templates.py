player_report_guidelines = """
Reporting another player is a serious matter. Violations of our main rules and guidelines that have an impact on another's roleplay must have consequences. Maintain roleplay at all times; if the effort of the reporting party to continue the scenario through roleplay is not shown, then the report may be immediately dismissed. Also known as "roleplay over ruleplay." Please remember that everything will be taken into consideration and warnings may be issued to the parties that deserve them, which may include the reporting party.

The full guidelines: http://bit.ly/nonstoprpreports

Your report *may* be dismissed at staff's discretion if it fails to follow our guidelines.

This is a formal report and all replies are expected to be formal - therefor a 5 minute slowmode has been enacted.

**The staff and support team have completed their review of this player report ticket with the following findings**: 

**Summary**: 

**Rule Breaks**: 

**Verdict**: 

**Thank you for the report. Please keep in mind these reports are reviewed by several members of Staff and Support with the evidence and statements provided in the report to determine if there were rule breaks and if warning points are to be given. We also take previous warning points and warning history into account. Staff uses these factors to determine these verdicts. These decisions are final and we ask that you do not open further tickets to try to continue reports or argue the outcome as this could result in additional warning points.**
